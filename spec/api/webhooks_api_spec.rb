  # unit tests for webhooks_post
  # Create a new webhook
  # Creates a new webhook and returns its details. Note that specifying an event which triggers the webhook combines 2 parameters - &#39;event_action&#39; and &#39;event_object&#39;. E.g., use &#39;\\*.\\*&#39; for getting notifications about all events, &#39;added.deal&#39; for any newly added deals, &#39;deleted.persons&#39; for any deleted persons, etc. See https://app.pipedrive.com/webhooks for more details.
  # @param subscription_url A full, valid, publicly accessible URL. Determines where to send the notifications. Please note that you cannot use Pipedrive API endpoints as the subscription_url.
  # @param event_action Type of action to receive notifications about. Wildcard will match all supported actions.
  # @param event_object Type of object to receive notifications about. Wildcard will match all supported objects.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Float] :user_id ID of the user this webhook will be authorized with. If not set, current authorized user will be used. Note that this does not filter only certain user&#39;s events â€” rather, this specifies the user&#39;s permissions under which each event is checked. Events about objects the selected user is not entitled to access are not sent. If you want to receive notifications for all events, a top-level admin user should be used.
  # @option opts [String] :http_auth_user HTTP basic auth username of the subscription URL endpoint (if required).
  # @option opts [String] :http_auth_password HTTP basic auth password of the subscription URL endpoint (if required).
  # @return [nil]
