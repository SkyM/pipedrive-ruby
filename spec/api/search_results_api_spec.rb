  # unit tests for search_results_field_get
  # Perform a search using a specific field value
  # Performs a search from a specific field&#39;s values. Results can be either the distinct values of the field (useful for searching autocomplete field values), or actual items IDs (deals, persons, organizations or products). Works only with the following field types: varchar, varchar_auto, double, address, text, phone, date.
  # @param term Search term to look for, minimum 2 characters.
  # @param field_type Type of the field to perform the search from.
  # @param field_key Key of the field to search from. Field key can be obtained by fetching the list of fields using any of fields API GET methods (dealFields, personFields, ..).
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :exact_match When enabled, only full exact matches against the given term are returned. By default, term can be present anywhere in the resulting field values to be considered a match. The minimum 2 character limit for the term is discarded when exact_match is enabled.
  # @option opts [String] :return_field_key Name of the field in search results from which the search was performed. When omitted, &#39;value&#39; will be used. You may want to set this parameter to match the field_key.
  # @option opts [String] :return_item_ids Whether to return matching items IDs in search results. When omitted or set to 0, only distinct values of the searched field are returned. When enabled, the return_field_key parameter is ignored and the results include the searched field as its own key.
  # @option opts [Float] :start Pagination start
  # @option opts [Float] :limit Items shown per page
  # @return [nil]
